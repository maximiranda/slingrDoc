Welcome to Slingr! On this page, we will guide you through the process of getting started with our platform.

First of all, you might be wondering, what exactly is Slingr? Slingr is a cloud app creation platform that seamlessly integrates with other SaaS solutions available. You can learn more about Slingr [here]({{< ref "what_is_slingr.md" >}}). Additionally, if you want to understand how our platform works, you can take a look [here]({{<ref "/extending/getting_started/overview.md" >}}).

Once you have a better understanding of what Slingr is, the next step is to create a developer account. By doing so, you can begin creating apps and experimenting with our platform, which is the best way to learn how to use it. To create a developer account, simply visit the [Developer Portal sign-up page](https://developer-portal.slingrs.io/signUp.html).

After you have created your account, we highly recommend that you follow these [tutorials]({{<ref "/getting-started/getting/first-steps/main.md">}}) which will guide you through the most important features and steps of creating apps in Slingr. As you work through these tutorials, be sure to reference the [Developerâ€™s Reference]({{< ref "/dev-reference/overview/overview.md">}}) to get more detailed information about the various features available.

To gain a solid understanding of the basics of app development with Slingr, we strongly encourage you to read through the following pages:

- [App Development Overview]({{< ref "/dev-reference/overview/overview.md">}})
- [Pushing and Syncing Changes]({{< ref "/dev-reference/metadata-management/pushing-and-syncing.md">}})
- [Development Process]({{< ref "/dev-reference/metadata-management/development-process.md">}})
- [Automatic Refactorings]({{< ref "/dev-reference/metadata-management/automatic-refactorings.md" >}})

For more information on how to manage your apps, take a look at our [Managing Apps]({{< ref "/platform-ref/slingr-dev-portal/managing-apps.md">}}) page.
