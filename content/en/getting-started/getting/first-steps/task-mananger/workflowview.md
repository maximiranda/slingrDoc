Welcome back! In this section, let's take a look at the new workflow view. If you are not on the runtime of your app yet, you can open it through the developer portal.

As you can see from the first image, we have built an awesome app with just a few configurations. Try it out and make sure that the actions and transitions are working as expected.

To execute actions, you can click the button on the top-right of the card. In this case, only the Archive action is available since we configured it that way. You should also be able to execute other actions by moving the card through the different columns.

To create new tasks, click on the Create button and a pop-up will open. You can move the cards through the different columns, but keep in mind that only the movements we configured will be allowed. For example, moving a card from the To do column to the Done column should not be possible.

Lastly, you can also rank tasks (move them up and down) in the workflow view. Pretty awesome, right? Our app is starting to look amazing. In the next section, we will create different roles for the app's users and assign them appropriate permissions. See you in the next section!
