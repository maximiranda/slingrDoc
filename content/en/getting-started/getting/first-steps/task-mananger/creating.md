Once you're logged into the developer portal, follow these steps:

1. Click on the New App button in the Your Apps section.
2. Fill in the app label and name. The name must be unique on the platform.
3. Select Slingr Free as your app's plan.
4. Select the option to start from scratch.
5. Wait for the app creation process to complete.

Once your app is created, you'll see its details. By default, you'll be the owner of the app with developer permissions for the development environment, which is created by default.

In the environment details, you can navigate through the different components of your app:

- Go To App: This button takes you to your running app. However, since you haven't done anything yet, the app is empty.
- Monitor: From here, you can see the app's status, background jobs, logs, and more. If you need to know what's going on with your app, this is the place to look.
- Builder: This is where you'll develop your app.
You can also see the different environments and components on the Apps Page.

The first button is the Runtime, the second the monitor, and the third one the builder. 
As our new app is empty, the first thing we need to do is to go to the app builder, by clicking on the builder button (the one with the wrench). That will automatically open the builder in a new tab.
